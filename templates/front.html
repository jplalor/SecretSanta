<h1>Hugemas 2012 Secret Santa</h1>
<p>
Hello there!! As you may or may not have heard, we are doing a Secret Santa this year.  For those that don't know what that is, each person will buy presents for one other person, and keep it a surprise until the gift exchange (date and time TBD).</p>
<p>
I made a little form to keep track of who is going to take part.  If you sign up, you have to buy a present for someone, because your name will be given to another person, and they'll be buying you a gift as well. So don't screw it up!
</p>


That is all.
